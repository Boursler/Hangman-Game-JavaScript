# Hangman-Game-JavaScript
This is a simple game of Hangman that can be played by pressing keys on the keyboard.

The theme of the game is American Independence, with words chosen due to their association with the American Revolutionary War. The game is written in JavaScript and makes use of Bootstrap for its layout, as well as backgrounds from Subtle Patterns: https://www.toptal.com/designers/subtlepatterns/. 

HTML for the game can be found at the top-level index.html file. Game logic is found in the assets/javascript directory. The game uses a preset dictionary of American Independence related words. Logic is split between two top-level objects: a game object which controls function related to game state and a screen object which controls the display.
